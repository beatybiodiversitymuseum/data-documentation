# Data cleaning workflow
Today, we will go through a worked example of data cleaning. We'll start with getting the data from Specify through a query, working on it in Excel (or with R or Python), and then re-uploading to Specify. We'll also look at the `Batch Edit` function and when to use it vs. when to use the `Workbench`.

Even though we'll be looking at Specify, the lessons learned here would apply to any data cleaning workflow.
