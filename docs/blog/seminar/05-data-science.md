Happy New Year! This year, the informatics seminar will be focusing on doing data science with the Beaty's data resources. Today, we will discuss the basic goals of data science and mechanics of data pipelines. We will review last term's seminar topics in light of data science goals, and focus on how to not just get data INTO Specify, but to get it OUT of Specify and into people's hands. If you missed some seminars last year, this will be a great way to get re-oriented.

## Notes
Notes for the seminar will be posted here afterwards.
