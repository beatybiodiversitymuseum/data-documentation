The Beatyâ€™s main databasing system is Specify 7, a relational database developed for natural history museums. Relational databases are use an object-oriented metaphor, where the rows of the tables (think Excel table) in the database represent objects (whether physical or abstract) and the columns represent attributes of those objects. This object-oriented metaphor explains the database schema choices that the Specify 7 developers have made, but it also produces benefits and drawbacks for people who are trying to record and find data.

In this seminar, we will start with a tutorial on relational databases and object-oriented data modelling. We will discuss how this applies to specifically to Specify 7, but also modelling bioinformatics data in general. Attendees will have a chance to discuss their own data modelling challenges, and be empowered to make informed decisions about their own data models, whether in Specify 7 or another system. This will help with challenges you might behaving in data entry, querying, exporting, or the scientific validity of your data.

## Notes 
The a simplified version of the Specify data model looks like this:
