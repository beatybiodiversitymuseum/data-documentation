Many common data models use a format called eXtensible Markup Language (XML). There are many markup languages, HTML (hypertext markup language) being one of the most well-known. Markup languages can be used to encode metadata within text, and are therefore used for many of the common document formats that we use on a daily basis. For example, a Microsoft Word document is really just a wrapper for a set of XML documents!

In this seminar, we'll learn how to read and write markup languages, focusing on XML and HTML. We'll apply them to the form editor on Specify. We'll also explore how XML can be used in archival data storage formats.

## Notes
Notes for the seminar will be posted here afterwards.
