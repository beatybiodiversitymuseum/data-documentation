# Welcome to the Beaty Biodiversty Museum Data Blog
This blog contains production notes for feature development at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum. It's being developed to:

1. Keep raw notes on feature production.
2. Document the learning process for new features.
3. Provide a place to work out ideas before committing to a simplified documentation page.

For official documentation, please search through the docs pages.
