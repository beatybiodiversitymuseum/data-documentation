# Download query results as a csv

Downloading the results of a query can be a great way to view hundreds or thousands of records at a time. 

1. Run the query by clicking the `Query` button in the bottom right corner.
2. Above the results table, click `Create CSV`. This will create a popup telling you that your csv is being prepared. The time that it takes for the csv to be ready is proportional to the size and complexity of your query.
3. In the bottom left hand corner, the :material-bell: icon and `Notifications` tab will flash orange. This means your csv is ready. Click on `Notifications`.
4. You will find a notification at the top of the list that reads "Query export to CSV completed.". Press the green `Download` button to download the csv file to your computer.
