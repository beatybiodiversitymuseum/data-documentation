# Edit PrepTypes for a collection

PrepTypes sort preparations into categories. For example, a PrepType may be a jar, or a skull, or a wing. PrepTypes exist in a pre-defined list for users to pick from during data entry or upload.

## Adding a PrepType to a collection

While logged into Specify and in the collection you wish to modify, navigate to the following link

```
https://database.beatymuseum.ubc.ca/specify/view/preptype/new
```

Type the PrepType you would like to add to the list. If the PrepType can be loaned, click the checkbox next to `Is Loanable`. Click `Save` to save the new item to the list.

!!! warning

    If you wish to add more than one PrepTypes to the list, you must press `Add`. If you edit the text in the textbox and click `Save`, it will edit the PrepType just created.

## Edit a PrepType from a collection

Navigate to the following url. This will enable you to construct a query to view the current PrepTypes for a collection

```
https://database.beatymuseum.ubc.ca/specify/query/new/preptype
```

Add the `Is Loanable` and `Name` fields to the query. The operator should be `Any`. Run the query.

You may use the :material-open-in-new: button to open a single PrepType in a new tab, or select all of the PrepTypes you wish to edit by clicking the checkbox next to those records. You can change the Name of the PrepType and click `Save`.

    If the `Delete` button contains an :fontawesome-solid-triangle-exclamation: icon, this means that there are preparations that use the PrepType you are trying to delete. In order to successfully delete the PrepType, you must first change the PrepType of the associated preparations so that they are not equal to the PrepType you are trying to delete.
