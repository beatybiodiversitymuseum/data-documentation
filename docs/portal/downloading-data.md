# Downloading data

!!! info

    Functionality outlined on this page requires a GBIF account.

You may wish to download data to analyze it in excel or via your favourite programming language. Downloading data also generates a DOI which [should be used to cite the data if you use the data for a publication](https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines). Citing research helps recognize the work that scientists did to produce and curate the data for use.

The best way to download data is to narrow down the data you wish to use through filters, and then pressing the `Download` button. This will assemble a derived dataset with just the records you need, and create a DOI that is specific to the time that you downloaded it. Depending on the size of your download request, it may take some time to get ready. A notification will be sent to the email you register with GBIF when the download is ready.
